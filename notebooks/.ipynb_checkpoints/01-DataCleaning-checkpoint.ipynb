The\\\\n                Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome\\\\n                of Evil. The most sinister woman to\\\\n                dance on the face of the earth.

Even the\\\\n        Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially\\\\n        Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and\\\\n        accompanies from the table with the guitar.<BREAK>        When the music builds to its explosive section.<BREAK>        Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the\\\\n        room.<BREAK>        She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with\\\\n        the beat.

He begins explaining with pointing what\\\\n        Seth and company did to Chet.<BREAK>        Richard continues to suck her toes.<BREAK>        The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard\\\\\\'s\\\\n        mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks\\\\n        down at the seated Richard.<BREAK>        She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His\\\\n        mouth OPENS because she\\\\\\'s hurting him. She LEANS her FACE\\\\n        OVER his like she\\\\\\'s going to kiss him. Then let\\\\\\'s the whiskey\\\\n        from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd\\\\n        applauds. She lets go of Richard\\\\\\'s hair. Except for Jacob\\\\n        and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,\\\\n        none louder than Seth.<BREAK><CENTER>       SETH\\\\n                Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

Chet\\\\\\'s eyes roll\\\\n        up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.<BREAK>        GULP.<BREAK>        Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard\\\\n        moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his\\\\n        mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle.

Most of the\\\\n        vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the\\\\n        customers have been butchered or drained.<BREAK>        All that\\\\\\'s left on the vampire side are two naked dancers\\\\n        and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his\\\\n        kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who\\\\n        are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding\\\\n        wooden stakes.<BREAK>        The four human men group together.

Everybody shields their eyes from the intense\\\\n        light, which lasts only a split second.<BREAK>        It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All\\\\n        that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies\\\\n        once lay.<BREAK>        They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN\\\\n        for the door. It\\\\\\'s locked. They BANG on the door, but it\\\\\\'s\\\\n        useless. It ain\\\\\\'t budging, yet they all go on banging.<BREAK>        Except for Seth. He never ran for the door.

I\\\\n                love you, too.<BREAK>        Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him\\\\n        down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.\\\\n        He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down\\\\n        to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big\\\\n        bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him\\\\n        from Richard\\\\\\'s grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have\\\\n        surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his\\\\n        head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a\\\\n        wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to\\\\n        where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the\\\\n        wood in the biker\\\\\\'s hand. He knows what that means.

He sits up and sees all the furious\\\\n        activity. Everyone\\\\\\'s so busy they don\\\\\\'t notice their new\\\\n        friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who\\\\\\'s\\\\n        putting a board into place.

The\\\\n        others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,\\\\n        Big Emilio\\\\\\'s baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.\\\\n        As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out\\\\n        of Kate\\\\\\'s shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the\\\\n        vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her\\\\n        and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and\\\\n        SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp\\\\\\'s head, breaking\\\\n        the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the\\\\n        vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one\\\\n        of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp\\\\\\'s\\\\n        heart. He dies and bursts into flames.<BREAK>        At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting\\\\n        position.

The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,\\\\n        SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for\\\\n        a loop.<BREAK>        As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS\\\\n        on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a\\\\n        stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate\\\\n        by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is\\\\n        lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine\\\\n        raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the\\\\n        vamp\\\\\\'s black heart.

Seth\\\\\\'s hand GRABS the\\\\n        bat\\\\\\'s neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has\\\\n        its CLAWS DUG in Seth\\\\\\'s clothes.

Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake\\\\n        down in the body\\\\\\'s chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.\\\\n        Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of\\\\n        his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him\\\\n        get bit.

Frost BASHES his head\\\\n        against the bar six or seven times.
